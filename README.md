# groovy-cli
A Groovy command line options builder

This repository is where the Groovy-based CLI options builder I am coding will be located.
This is an exercise I am using to become familiar with the Groovy builder idea. 
The artifacts I produce will be available at Maven Central as io.coder451:groovy-cli:version.
